    <p>
      I am an engineer originally from the UK, now based in Tokyo. <br />
      I came to Japan for many of the same reasons that I am interested in technology
      - to learn new things and challenge myself. <br />
      You can find me all across the stack using Go, TypeScript, Python, and React.
