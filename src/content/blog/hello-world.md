### Yes, I know

First of all, welcome to my my tech blog. My name is Conall, I'm a British software engineer based in Tokyo.

While it's certainly clich√©, and I'm sure some kind of cardinal tech sin, to call your first post "Hello, World", I felt like following tradition this time. I hope you will indulge me.

### Let's Go

The picture above shows the classic hello world in C, but I'm more of a gopher myself so in this first post I thought I would explain how to get up and running with a "Hello World" program in Go.

With go downloaded, change directory into where you want to work and run the following commands.

``` sh
mkdir hello_world
cd hello_world && touch hello.go
```

Open hello.go in your favourite text editor and type out the following...

``` go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World")
}

```
