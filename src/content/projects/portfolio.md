This portfolio was built using Astro, a MPA frontend framework. I chose to use Astro as being able to generate static pages for blogs and this project section was a major improvement over my previous purely React based website.

Astro also uses the interesting "islands architecture" which can lead to a more flexible and performant frontend, where there are "islands" of interactive components within a static page. Another reason for choosing Astro was that it has overall improved performance and smaller bundle sizes over other frameworks like Next.js.

Making this project also gave me the opportunity to dip my toe into the world of Three.js, a library for rendering 3D content in the browser. This was both an interesting and challenging new area that I explored through this project as it requires knowledge unrelated to general frontend development.
