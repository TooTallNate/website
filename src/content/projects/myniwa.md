My Niwa is an application designed to help people to start and maintain new habits. By creating a "Niwa" - a personal garden - and tending to it every day - maintaining their habits - the user will start to grow alongside their flowers.

Built in a small group of five developers. My main role was on the frontend team, tasked with designing and building out the UI using React, Material UI and CSS modules, Framer Motion for interactions/animations and Recoil for state management.
